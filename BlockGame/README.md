# BlockGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.3 while following a tutorial on [Unreal Sensei](https://www.unrealsensei.com/).

First Person Shooter and Minecraft Clone hybrid with drones that spawn in waves, and can detect and chase the player. 

Features:
* 100% Blueprints. 0% C++.
* Standard FPS controls:  WASD to move, mouse to look around.
* Can switch between weapons and blocks.
* Using Weapons: Left click to fire.
* Using Blocks: Right click to place a block, hold left click to destroy blocks.
* Can take damage from drones and magma blocks, and can heal from water blocks. (And yes, player can die!)
* Blocks are saved in a save game, so will persist across multiple sessons.
* Drones spawn in waves. Each time a wave is cleared, more drones will spawn in the next wave.
* Drones will roam until they see the player then start chasing the player.
* Drone AI is implemented using Blueprint Tree & Tasks.
